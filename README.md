# CoolConvNN
Complete, simple and cool convolutional neural network, build from scratch, parallel(CPU only) and almost dependency free(OpenMP). Support custom layers, restricted to ReLU activation.

## Introduction

This software was coded with only learning purposes, not for production uses. The aim of use is myself, optimized for run in a intel CPU.
Apart of that, it is fully functioning, the FC layers uses Batch normalization and ReLU, Convolutional Layers also use bn and ReLU activation. The Max-Pool layer is applied after each convolution. The weights learning is done using mini-batch sgd.

It uses LodePNG (https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng) for png to float arrays conversion.

External data is supported, following the csv format:

### Installing

Clone the repository and run make in the folder. (gcc)

#### How to use

params.ini Define the cnn architecture:

```
2 // [conv+relu][pool] layers
1 32 1 3 1 28 28 // conv1: input depth, number of filters, stride, filterSize, padding, input width, input height
2 2 32 0 28 28 // pool1: stride, filterSize, depth, padding, input width, input height
32 64 1 3 1 14 14 // conv2
2 2 64 0 14 14 // pool2
0 // additional fully connected layers
3136 16 512 // features dimension, number of labels, size of fc
256 0.05 // batch size and learning rate
```

Start learning:

```
./cnn_c new [epochs] [validation_set_split]
```

Continue learning (you may set the learning rate in params.ini):

```
./cnn_c continue [epochs] [validation_set_split]
```

Test sample:
```
./cnn_c test [sample_path]
```
