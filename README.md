# CoolConvNN
Complete, simple and cool convolutional neural network framework, built from scratch, parallel able with OpenMP and almost dependency free. Supports custom architectures.

## Introduction

This project aims to be a dependency free implementation, in C, of a accessible deep learning framework.

Current features, activations, optimizer and layers:

* Convolutional layer
* MaxPool layer
* Fully Connected layer
* Batch normalization as default in Convolutional and fully-connected layers.
* ReLU activation
* Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent

To do:
* Attention layer
* Deconvolutional layer
* Dropout
* Leaky ReLU activation
* Adam optimizer

It uses LodePNG (https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng) for png to float arrays conversion.

External data is supported, following the csv format:

## Installing

You may need to specify the header of cblas_sgemm function in matrix.h

After that, just clone the repository and run make in the cloned folder

## How to use

params.ini Define the cnn architecture:

```
16
conv 1 32 1 5 2 64 64
batch_norm 32 4096
activate relu
max_pool 2 2 32 0 64 64
conv 32 32 1 3 1 32 32
batch_norm 32 1024
activate relu
max_pool 2 2 32 0 32 32
conv 32 32 1 3 1 16 16
batch_norm 32 256
activate relu
max_pool 2 2 32 0 16 16
fc 2048 512
batch_norm 512 1
activate relu
fc 512 2

```

```
[total number of layers]
[type(conv)] [input depth number_of_filters stride filter_size padding input_width input_height]
[type(max_pool)] [stride filter_size, depth, padding, input_width, input_height]
...
[type(fc)] [input_dim layer_size]
[type(batch_norm)] [channels spatial]
[type(activation)] [type]
...
[batch size]
```

Start fitting the data:

```
./cnn_c new [validation_set_split] [learning_rate] [l2_reg_lambda] [epochs] 
```

Continue fitting :

```
./cnn_c continue [validation_set_split] [learning_rate] [l2_reg_lambda] [epochs]
```

Test sample:

```
./cnn_c test [sample_path]
```
